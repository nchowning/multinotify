This script requires the following perl modules:
Gtk2::Notify
WebService::Prowl (Not yet, but soon)
IO::Socket::SSL (Not yet, but soon)

SETTING UP THE SERVER:
    -Edit multinotify-server.pl and add the listening IP address as well as the listening port
    -The default number of connections is 5 you can change that by modifying the "Listen" value
    -Be sure that you're not blocking access to the port that you decide to use

    Once the server is setup, run it with:
    perl multinotify-server.pl

SETTING UP THE IRSSI CLIENT:
    -Edit multinotify-irssi.pl to change IP_ADDRESS and PORT_NUMBER (located in the socketsend
    subroutine) to match the values that you entered in multinotify-server.pl

    Once you've edited it, copy it to ~/.irssi/scripts/ and do:
    /script load multinotify-irssi.pl

SETTING UP THE DESKTOP CLIENT:
    -Edit multinotify-client.pl to change IP_ADDRESS and PORT_NUMBER to match the values that
    you entered in multinotify-server.pl
    -You'll need to have Gtk2::Notify on the computer that you'll be running this on

    Once you've edited it, run it with:
    perl multinotify-client.pl

***************************************************************

-Use IO::Socket::SSL rather than IO::Socket::INET to secure the data
-Add support for growl and snarl to the desktop client
-Add support to the server to automatically send missed notifications to prowl
