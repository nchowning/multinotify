This script requires the following perl modules:
Gtk2::Notify or Cocoa::Growl (Destkop Client)
WebService::Prowl (Server)

SETTING UP THE SERVER:
    -Edit multinotify-server.pl and add the listening IP address as well as the listening port
    -The default number of connections is 5 you can change that by modifying the "Listen" value
    -Be sure that you're not blocking access to the port that you decide to use

    Once the server is setup, run it with the following command:
        perl multinotify-server.pl

SETTING UP THE IRSSI CLIENT:
    -Edit multinotify-irssi.pl to change $IPADDRESS and $PORT variable values to match the
     values set in multinotify-server.pl

    Once you've edited it, copy it to ~/.irssi/scripts/ and execute the following command inside
    of irssi:
        /script load multinotify-irssi.pl

SETTING UP THE DESKTOP CLIENT:
    -Edit multinotify-client.pl to change $IPADDRESS and $PORT variable values to match the
     values set in multinotify-server.pl
    -You'll need to have Gtk2::Notify (Linux) or Cocoa::Growl (Mac) on the computer that
     you'll be running this on

    Once you've edited it, run it with:
        perl multinotify-client.pl

***************************************************************

VERSION 1.3:
    -Added formatting for messages delivered via libnotify to the desktop client
    -Added prowl support to the server

VERSION 1.2:
    -Added multi-client support.  You can now run multiple irssi clients as well as
     multiple desktop clients.
    -Fixed issue with parameters passed to the &sendmessage subroutine in the server
    -Fixed connection issues with multiple receiving clients when a client disconnects
    -Fixed a lot of random stability issues
    -HUGE server code rewrite

VERSION 1.1:
    -Rewrote a good portion of the server code & added a lot of comments for things
     to add in the future.  Removed extra thread creation as it's no longer necessary

VERSION 1.0:
    -Removed use of IO::Select from the server in favor of creating a new thread for
     receiving clients
    -Updated the Desktop client to use Cocoa::Growl as opposed to Mac::Growl as
     Mac::Growl does not play well with 64-bit OS X.
